# Personal set of configuration files

Usage:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jstarkman/jas-config-files
$ jas-config-files/set-config-files
$ . ~/.bashrc # and refresh/restart other programs as needed
```

This is a collection of scripts, tools, and libraries that I find
useful to have on new systems.
